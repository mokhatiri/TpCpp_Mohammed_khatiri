# Instructions:

to test the functions, run the "make" command, (if in windows, use the wsl then run make)

lastly many of these need an input file including:
Exo2 -> data.txt ( a .txt with wanted data)

Exo3 -> input.txt ( a .txt with lines to search form)

// Exo1 doesn't need an input file

## make cleanall

use make cleanall to get rid of all the .txt files aswell as the .exe

make clean => gets rid of only the .exe
